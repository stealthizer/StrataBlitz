# StrataBlitz
A game created by AI

### Overview

This is a game created using cursor and claude, with almost 0 code interaction. To create the game I've used the .cursorrules and the docs/ folder, along with bing ai/gimp to create the sprites.

### How to play

You can execute from inside the folder that contains the index.html:

```
npx http-server -p 8080
```

and then open http://localhost:8080 on your favourite(*) browser
